# Harry Potter - RPG

This game requires you to pick 1 of 4 Harry Potter characters(Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, or Draco Malfoy). After that, you face off with your chosen hero against the 3 characters you did not pick!. Their attacks do the same damage every single turn, while yours doubles by its base damage after every attack. It's a 1 v 3!, we have to get you some kind of leg up! The game is over when either you die, or all 3 opponents die. Have fun!
